                    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Minor cuts and scrapes usually don&#39;t require a trip to the emergency room. But if your wound is deep &mdash; all the way through the skin &mdash; jagged, or exposing fat or muscle, see a doctor as soon as possible. You may need stitches. Proper wound closure within a few hours minimizes scarring and reduces the risk of infection.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">These guidelines can help you care for minor cuts and scrapes:</span></p><ol class="c3 lst-kix_39xdgdss4uhy-0 start" start="1"><li class="c5"><span class="c16">Wash your hands.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;This helps avoid infection.</span></li><li class="c5"><span class="c16">Stop the bleeding.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Minor cuts and scrapes usually stop bleeding on their own. If needed, apply gentle pressure with a clean bandage or cloth and elevate the wound until bleeding stops.</span></li><li class="c5"><span class="c16">Clean the wound.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Rinse the wound with water. Keeping the wound under running tap water will reduce the risk of infection. Wash around the wound with soap. But don&#39;t get soap in the wound. And don&#39;t use hydrogen peroxide or iodine, which can be irritating. Remove any dirt or debris with a tweezers cleaned with alcohol. See a doctor if you can&#39;t remove all debris.</span></li><li class="c5"><span class="c16">Apply an antibiotic or petroleum jelly.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Apply a thin layer of an antibiotic ointment or petroleum jelly to keep the surface moist and help prevent scarring. Certain ingredients in some ointments can cause a mild rash in some people. If a rash appears, stop using the ointment.</span></li><li class="c5"><span class="c16">Cover the wound.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Apply a bandage, rolled gauze or gauze held in place with paper tape. Covering the wound keeps it clean. If the injury is just a minor scrape or scratch, leave it uncovered.</span></li><li class="c5"><span class="c16">Change the dressing.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Do this at least once a day or whenever the bandage becomes wet or dirty.</span></li><li class="c5"><span class="c16">Get a tetanus shot.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Get a tetanus shot if you haven&#39;t had one in the past five years and the wound is deep or dirty.</span></li><li class="c5"><span class="c16">Watch for signs of infection.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;See a doctor if you see signs of infection on the skin or near the wound, such as redness, increasing pain, drainage, warmth or swelling.</span></li></ol><p class="c18 c23"><span class="c14"></span></p>

You may be advised to begin cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). If you haven&#39;t received CPR training, doctors recommend skipping mouth-to-mouth rescue breathing and performing only chest compressions (about 100 per minute).
